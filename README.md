# Morehead-City-Basemap
I choose what I thought would have been a better base map for the Morehead City Zoning Map (my Midterm exam). I 
colors are distinct from each other while also being formiliar to users. I highlighted the streets and buildings 
needed in a zoning map. I only highlighted these features to keep a clean map. I continually ran into an issue with 
one element of the Java Script Library. I believe this is the one obsticale to my final product.
